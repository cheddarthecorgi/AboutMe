    <h2 style="color: white;">Career Goals</h2>
  <p style="color: white;">
    Coding. You can <em>change the WORLD</em> through coding.
    You can code something that furthers cancer research or makes farming more efficient for agricultural workers. The possibilities are endless! 
    I want to pursue programming as a career and become a software engineer. To be a part of the future is absolutely fascinating to me! 
    There are obviously a lot of steps, but I plan to achieve this by studying at a great college for computer science, getting internships working on research with professors, and try to code more projects for fun.
    So far, my (very limited) experience in programming has been incredibly fun! I love messing around, finding out new things, and learning!
    </p>
  <h2 style="color: white;">Intro and Experience</h2>
  <p style="color: white;">
  I've worked diligently and passionately in my work in various subjects and activities. 
  Through debate and public speaking, I've honed assertiveness and amazing public speaking skills, which have been incredibly helpful in effective communication and critical thinking.
  I've always ensured that I stick with a problem until I fix it, which I've proven in many tasks such as debugging, analyzing flaws in debate, and doing my best to learn complicated concepts and material.
  As co-president of the math club, I work with students at my school to create a place of collaboration, tutoring, and problem-solving.
  I took the SAT as an eighth grader and received 1470, which allowed me to open up a new world in my love for tutoring math and really all subjects.
  <br><br>
  With a part-time job as a tutor and nearly 50 volunteering hours in tutoring, I've committed myself to helping others learn, which has enhanced my patience and understanding of concepts.
  I love to challenge myself, and I do so by taking the hardest classes offered to me. Doing so has allowed me to develop better organizational skills, and critical thinking skills, and understand the importance of effective time management.    
  </p>
  <h2 style="color: white;">Summary</h2>
  <p style="color: white;">
    Even though I'm just starting high school, I look forward to developing more projects, honing my communication and problem-solving skills, and fostering my love for programming.
    I love working and volunteering as a tutor, which is a valuable skill to have as it enforces me to learn content better so I can explain it.
    With my public speaking and communication skills, I hope to continue debating and analyzation. Someday, I will be a software engineer, and I will love every second of it.
